<p>The most famous Kenya Animals are known as 'The Big 5' and the animals behind the 'The Big 5' are: Lions, Leopards, Elephants, Buffalos and Rhinos.</p>

<p>It sure is a sight to behold to see these animals in their natural habitats and in their elements. You also recognize that it is you who is visiting their home. It will be a good idea to make sure not to overstep your boundaries and respect the animals habitats. It can be a humbling experience, but also an amazing one, to visit with these incredible beasts!</p>

<p>It is a wonderful......well, sometimes a little scary thing to hear the roar of a Lion in the heart of the night, in the middle of nowhere, in a tent with no fences anywhere close. It is an encounter, that you will remember as a very special moment.</p>

<p>There is something to be said about experiencing all this in the real surroundings and not at home in your living room in front of a TV or while visiting a Zoo. To hear, feel and smell it, is indeed the 'Real Deal'.</p>

<p>Besides these 'Big 5' there are many other animals and every single one is incredible to watch. From the Giraffes, Zebras, Hippos, Baboons, Wildebeests, Warthog to all the different Antelopes, Gazelles and numerous, distinctive Bird species. 
</p>
<p>The habitats of these animals range from the Savannah, to Forest areas all the way to Wetlands. If you move around a bit, you will have an excellent chance of seeing all these Kenya animals.</p>

<p>When on safari most tour operators will include visits to these different habitats to give you a complete picture of the wildlife and ecosystems of Kenya.</p>
